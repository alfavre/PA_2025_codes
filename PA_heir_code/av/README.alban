TAKE INPUT IN YEARS, NOT DAYS

this targets the tfhe-rs, which is better for operations on int

so the better opt operations would be:

--forward-store-to-load
--secretize
--secret-distribute-generic
--secret-to-cggi
--cggi-to-tfhe-rust


also the tranlsate level may need --use-levels I don't know why
